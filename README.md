plenario is an open source project which focuses on the results of the brazilian senate.
it was coded during the four last days of a front-end bootcamp as final work. 

plenario was idealized and coded by @gabrielacaesar.
@guisoares2011 has kindly helped with a pull request.
and I also had some help of three teachers who work for senai santa cecília, located in são paulo, brazil.

the main idea is to offer a social control tool that stimulates the social participation and transparency. 
we believe accountability is important to consolidate democracies.

and, of course, with internet and social media, it gets easier to reach the politicians. 
we should make use of this advantage.

we elect senators every four years. all the 26 states and Distrito Federal are represented by three senators.
in total, they are 81 senadors. each one also have two substitutes, in case the senator die, get a license or resign.

when elected, the senator guarantee at least eight years in power. 

and, of course, a huge list of benefits, such as apartment in Brasíia, car, employees (sometimes, more than 80 people) and more than R$ 40.000 available to spend per month with general spending. 

why shouldn't we keep our eyes on them, even before the election?

why shouldn't we contact them and ask about the recent decisions?


<b>metodology</b>
1 - the first version on plenario presents the results of 12 propositions voted by senators. 
all of them have been covered by the media and might be of society's interest.

two of 12 propositions are about the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, in august 2016. 
they have been choosen due to the relevance.

the more recent proposition, "reforma trabalhista", was voted in july 2017.

2 - the votings of indications are secrets. so again we can't know exactly how each senador voted.
this happened when Alexandre de Moraes, former Minister for Justice, was indicated to the Supreme Court.

there is also vote by acclamation, when we can't know exactly how each senator voted in these cases.
fortunately, due to the nominal votings, we do have the opened results of the most polemic and important issues.

3 - the data was collected of the official website [www.senado.leg.br].
we think that it's better to communicate with less variables as possible. 

this explains why we've decide to unify these labels:
"licença saúde", aka LS;
"senador em missão", aka MIS;
"atividade política/cultural", aka AP;
"licença particular", aka LP.

on plenario, all these labels are called "ausente".

following this logic, we've decided to unify two others labels:
"presente, mas não registrou voto", aka P-NRV;
"presidente" (since the presidente of the senate is coordenating the voting, he doesn't vote).

on plenario, all these labels are called "não votou".

4 - we are concerned not to get people confused. that's why we have considered the current party of the senator. 

although Ângela Portela was affiliated with PT during the impeachment, her current party is PDT.
pleario will always show Ângela Portela affiliated to PDT. 

the same situation happens with Alvaro Dias and Romário, for example. 
both have migrated to Podemos, former PTN.
